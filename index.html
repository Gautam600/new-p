       <h1>Where was origami found</h1>
       <h2>Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.</h2>
       <h2>
        In 1000 AD origami was only practised by elites.
        Before it was known as origami in japenese it was meant as folding paper.

            Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat</h2>

<h2>The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.
    The Teddy Bears' Picnic song was originally called The Teddy Bear Two Step.
    The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.
    In 1902 in Germany, Steiff launched “Bear 55 PB”, the first toy bear with jointed arms and legs.</h2>
